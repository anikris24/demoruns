            <strong>Telerik UI for Blazor</strong> provides a comprehensive suite of native UI components for building modern web apps with Blazor. All components are written from the ground up to be true native Blazor components, not wrappers over existing JavaScript libraries. This means you get all the benefits of the Blazor framework, including high performance, easy development, and a great developer experience.
            <br /><br />
            The library includes over 100 components, ranging from simple buttons and inputs to complex data grids, charts, and schedulers. All components are highly customizable and can be easily themed to match your application's design.
            <br /><br />
            With Telerik UI for Blazor, you can build beautiful, high-performance Blazor applications faster than ever before. The components are designed to be easy to use and integrate into your existing projects. Plus, Telerik provides extensive documentation, demos, and support to help you get started. This amount of text should be sufficient to demonstrate the overflow behavior of the container. If not, we can add even more content to ensure the scrollbar appears as expected. Let's add a bit more just in case.
            <br /><br />
            Blazor is a free and open-source web framework that enables developers to create web apps using C# and HTML. It is being developed by Microsoft.
